# PView - Customizable Forum Thread Viewer for Blind Users

## Overview

Online discussion forums play a vital role in facilitating global discussions across diverse topics, yet their usability for blind users remains underexplored. Our project, PView, addresses this gap by introducing a browser extension designed to enhance the interaction experience of blind users with forum conversations, specifically tailored for screen reader technology.

### Problem Statement

Blind users often face challenges while navigating forum threads due to redundant content and limited customization options. In an interview study, participants expressed frustration with the interaction experience, motivating the development of PView.

### Solution - PView Features

PView offers a solution by empowering blind users to customize forum thread content in real time, enhancing their interaction experience. Key features include:

- **Content Customization**: Blind users can explicitly hide irrelevant posts.
- **Real-time Filtering**: PView automatically filters subsequent similar posts in real time, improving thread navigation.
