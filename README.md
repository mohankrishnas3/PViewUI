## Research Paper Overview

This project is based on the research paper titled "Enabling Customization of Discussion Forums for Blind Users." The paper addresses the usability challenges blind users face while interacting with online discussion forums and introduces the PView browser extension as a solution to enhance their experience.

## Abstract

Online discussion forums serve as crucial platforms for global discourse on various topics, yet their usability for blind users, who rely on screen reader technology, remains relatively unexplored. In our interview-based study, blind participants highlighted the challenges they face while engaging with forum conversations, citing the overwhelming redundancy in content and the lack of customizable viewing options as major pain points. To address these issues, we developed PView - a browser extension tailored for blind users, allowing real-time customization of forum thread content.

PView empowers blind users to selectively tailor their forum experience by enabling the explicit hiding of irrelevant posts. Furthermore, the extension employs real-time algorithms to detect and filter subsequent posts resembling the hidden content, enhancing navigation efficiency within the conversation threads. Our user study involving blind participants demonstrated a significant enhancement in usability, reduced workload, and increased satisfaction compared to the conventional forum interaction.

This repository contains the front-end UI template for PView, showcasing the user interface design. Please note that this template is for visualization purposes only and does not include functional back-end integration.
