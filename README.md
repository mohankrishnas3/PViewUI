## Research Paper Overview

This project is based on the research paper titled "Enabling Customization of Discussion Forums for Blind Users." The paper addresses the usability challenges blind users face while interacting with online discussion forums and introduces the PView browser extension as a solution to enhance their experience.

### Abstract

Online discussion forums have become integral components of various websites, facilitating global discussions on diverse topics. However, little attention has been given to the usability of these forums for blind users who rely on screen reader technology. The paper highlights the challenges faced by blind users due to redundant content and the lack of customization options in forum conversations. As a solution, the PView browser extension enables blind users to customize forum thread content in real time, improving their interaction experience significantly.
